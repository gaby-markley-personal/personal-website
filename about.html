        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3> Community Organizing</h3>
            <p> As a political organizer and climate activist in the LA Area, I love working with people, especially young people, to invest in communities and work together to tackle our big problems, like climate justice in BIPOC communities, advocating for homelessness reform, and more. My favorite part is meeting caring and intelligent people who are passionate about facing real life problems head on. </p>

        <h3> Sailing </h3>
            <p>At the end of college, I took a sailing class and it was the most fun I've ever had in my life. I have always loved the water, and to feel like you need to be in rhythm with the world around you in order to stay moving and afloat combines just the right about of danger and excitement. I don't go often (cause who has boat money) but when I can get out on the water, it's an absolute blast. I'd recommend trying it out if you live near a body of water and like a little danger!
            </p>

        <h3> Cooking</h3>
        <p> I've been a lifelong "foodie", and at a young age my parents bought me a cookbook that helped me discover my passion for experimentation in the kitchen. There's something so fun about being able to make food for people you love and seeing their faces light up when they are really enjoying themselves. I love trying to make new cuisines (I just tried my hand for the first time at Saag Paneer) but my favorite thing to cook is a spaghetti with homemade ragu sauce or a short rib in red wine sauce. </p>
